The newly appointed Vice-Chancellor of Anna University wanted to create an automated
grading system for the students to check their grade. When a student enters a mark, the
grading system displays the corresponding grade.
Write a program to solve the given problem.
Marks scored Grade
100 S
90 - 99 A
80 - 89 B
70 - 79 C
60 - 69 D
50 - 59 E
<50 F
Input format:
The input consists of one integer which corresponds to the marks scored by the student
Output format:
If a student marks greater than 100, print "Invalid Input". Otherwise, print the grade.
Sample Input:
78
Sample Output:C


marks = int(input("Enter the marks scored by the student: "))
if marks > 100:
    print("Invalid Input")
else:
    if marks == 100:
        grade = "S"
    elif 90 <= marks < 100:
        grade = "A"
    elif 80 <= marks < 90:
        grade = "B"
    elif 70 <= marks < 80:
        grade = "C"
    elif 60 <= marks < 70:
        grade = "D"
    elif 50 <= marks < 60:
        grade = "E"
    else:  
        grade = "F"
    
    print(f"Grade: {grade}")
